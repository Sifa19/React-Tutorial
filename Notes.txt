why should we not use CDN links to develop our project?
    - making a request to fetch react script from CDN is costly,
      if we have react, already in node modules it is easy to use.
    - if the react gets updated, we will need to update the
      CDN Links manually to update react in our project.
    - managing the react is easy and convinient in package.json.

difference between npm and npx?
    npm - install package
    npx - execute package

What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
    - it makes react app fast, how?

parcel 
    - It gives dev build
    - It gives local server to host the app.
    - Error Handling.
    - HMR - Hot Module Replacement (What is Hot Module Replacement?)
            parcel uses file watching algorithm written in c++, 
            It keeps track of all the files 
            which are changing realtime and 
            it tells the server to reload.
    - It gives faster builds because 
      of caching done in .parcel-cache. (What is `.parcel-cache`)
    - It also does Image Optimization.
    - In Production build it will do 
      Minification, Bundling and Compression.
    - Consistent Hashing (Learn in detail)
    - Code Spliting (Learn in detail)
    - Differential Bundling (Learn in detail)
    - Tree Shaking algorithm.
    - Different build for dev and prod.
