NOTES:
- Hooks can be used only inside components.
- always import hooks at top to prevent any inconsistency as react reads code synchronously.


###### useState() #######
This function allows us to update the state and triggers a
re-render of the component, ensuring our UI is always up-to-date with the
latest state.
- never create useState inside loops


###### useEffect() #######
If we have to do something after the rendercycle complets 
we can pass it inside the ‘ useEffect() ' . 
this is the actual use case of useEffect. 
It is really helpful to render data which 
we will get after the ‘ fetch() ' operation
‘ useEffect() ' takes two arguments .
    1. Callback function.
    2. Dependency Array.
        - if no dependency Array useEffect is callled on every render
        - [] empty dependency array - useEffect is called just once on initial render
        - if state is given as dependency, useEffect is called everytime state is updated
